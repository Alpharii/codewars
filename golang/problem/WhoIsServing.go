// Table tennis: Who's serving?

// Your colleagues enjoy playing table tennis, but they often forget who should serve in each round. They ask you to create a program that will determine the serving player based on the current round number.

// Rules
// The game starts with the first round, or currentRound=1.
// Player 1 always starts the game by serving.
// A serving player alternates every two rounds
// currentRound cannot be a negative number or zero
// The original game rules are simplified: there is no "deuce" exception (service does not alternate at every point after '10-10')
// Examples
// The Player 1 serves in the 1st round
// The Player 1 serves in the 2nd round
// The Player 2 serves in the 3rd round
// The Player 2 serves in the 4th round
// The Player 1 serves in the 5th round
// The Player 1 serves in the 6tx round
// The Player 2 serves in the 7th round
// The Player 2 serves in the 8th round
// And so on
